## Step 4 - Time for some Power
So you got lots of resources processed, even if a little slowly and your
ready to ditch the slow machines for the fast and automated ones. 
Well not so fast, because first we need energy to power them with, coal
just isn't going to cut it anymore.

There are many generators to choice from in this plugin, but to get us 
started, lets use the [[Solid Fuel Generator]], but feel free to checkout
the generators section of the wiki for more to try out!

The [[Solid Fuel Generator]]  burns normal Minecraft fuels including Coal,
it can be a quick and easy way to get up and running using fuel you already
have. Craft this machine, place it down and open up it's interface.

When opening the generator you will see a few things stand out, firstly on
the left is a bar representing the internal buffer of energy storage the
generator has. Almost all machines will have an internal energy storage, 
the size of it differs by machine. When looking at the machine you may notice
a bar at the top of your screen which shows this internal energy without
opening the machine up.

The middle slot on this generator is where you place your fuel, as soon as 
you do, the energy lighting bolt under the slot will begin to animate showing
that it's working. You can also use a hopper into this machine to fill it up.

Lastly, the most complicated part is the weird lot of buttons on the right. 
These buttons control which side the machine outputs energy, if you click one
then it will go green meaning that side is outputting. Look at the colour around
the button and match this to the coloured sides on the block.

Now if we craft a machine that requires energy, place it next to the generator
and lastly set that side of the generator to output energy. Everything will start
working... well as long as you remembered the fuel.


## Step 5 - Next Steps
So we have power... but what can we do with it. 
Check out the rest of the wiki pages, as well as the in game recipe book and try
out all the exciting things you can now build and use.

Most machines will come in multiple variants: e.g. Iron, Gold, Diamond, Emerald
The higher up a chain the machine is the better it will be, check out it's 
wiki page for the exact numbers.
To explain this a little more, an Iron Electric Furnace will be a lot slower
than a Diamond Electric Furnace.

Try making a Electric [[Foundry]] which will speed up you Steel production.
Using some hoppers you can automate putting resources into the foundry, you
could even speed up your Iron Ingot production with an [[Electric Furnace]]
which are faster than regular ones, as we mentioned above.

Tip: Don't just set machines to output energy on all sides, this can increase
the strain on the sever, so be nice and only use what you need.

## Step 6 - Next Steps and Beyond

### Energy Storage
Storage... If your a hoarder and you want to start collecting energy
ready for those large scale smelting projects, then the [[Energy Cell]] is
for you. When connected (Placed next to or by Power Grid) to a block
providing energy it will begin to store it. These blocks have high
capacities, as well as input and output.

### Energy Transfer
Got multiple bases or want to go more than a few blocks without
chaining cells. For this purpose we have the Power Grids. These evenly
distribute energy to all connected machines and if theres any stare to
energy cells.

First get a Power Connector and a [[Wrench]]. Place the Power Connector down
away from your generator. You can now right click the Power Connector to
start a connection and click the generator. This will create a wire
between them showing its connected to the grid. This beam will only show
when holding a powered block or wrench.

Now place a machine a few blocks away and right click the cell, then the
machine. This should form a new connection. You should now see energy
transfer from the generator to the machine. You can even connect Power
Connectors together in a chain or any other pattern.

### Simplifying Machine Setup
For large scale projects you can build a [[Configurator]], this allows
you to copy output configs. Left click to copy and right click to paste!
Shift Right click to clear currently copied config or just copy a
different one.

### Waste No Energy
Using a [[Wrench]] you can shift right click machines, this will break the
machine instantly and drop all items on the floor, but all energy in the 
machine will still be there when placed back down.
A little better than just breaking it with a pickaxe

### Tools
Check out all the tools that you can make, Sickles can destroy plants and 
grass in a large area. 
Drills are a quick mining tools that uses energy not durability.
Power Hammers can break blocks in a 3x3x1 area for quick digging of tunnels.
The Excavtor is the same, but in a shovel form.

### World Interaction Machines
Use the block breaker and placer to interact with the world. Create automated
tree farms, drawbridges and so much more.
