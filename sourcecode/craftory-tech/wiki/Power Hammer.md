## Overview

This powered tool is used to quickly break a 3x3 area of stone like blocks. 
Each Power Hammer is slower than their pick-axe equivalent as they break 9 blocks at once. 
They do not break as they use energy rather than durability.

## Usage

The Power Hammer is used the same as pickaxes, it is most effective on blocks like stone and ore.

The Power Hammer, like excavators will break a 3x3 area around the broken block (perpendicular to the direction it is hit from). Only blocks the Power Hammer can break will be broken by this feature. The Power Hammer wont work on blocks that the Excavator is used for (Dirt, Clay, Sand...)

Before use the Power Hammer must be charged. To charge place it in the charging slot in any cell, the higher tier cells charge faster.

100 energy is consumed for each block broken, mining a 3x3 square will consume 900 energy.
