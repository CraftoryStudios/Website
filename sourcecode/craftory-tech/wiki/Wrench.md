## Overview

The wrench is a handy tool with multiple functions. It can be used to;
pick up Energy blocks with Energy inside, connect Power Grids and more.

## Usage

* **Connecting Energy Grids** - Once you've placed down some Energy
  Connectors, right clicking one with a wrench and then another will
  form a connection between them. These connections can be made to
  machines as well!
* **Picking up Machines / Energy Cells with Energy Intact** - Ever
  wanted to move a machine or cell, but don't wanna lose the energy. Use
  a wrench by shift right clicking a block. It will break dropping item,
  but energy will still be there when placed back down.
