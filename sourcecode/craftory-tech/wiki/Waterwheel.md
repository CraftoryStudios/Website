## Usage

Inserting the Water Wheel into a Rotary Generator will place the wheel
into the world providing there is a 7x7x2 space in front of the
generator, with sufficient water at the lower levels.

By default the generator will try to place the wheel on its North face,
to change the face simply right click on an empty generator with a Water
Wheel or Windmill.

## Power Grid

This Rotary Generator can be connected to a Power Grid, this will allow
it to distribute energy across the grid.

## Breaking and Placing

To remove the Water Wheel either remove the item from the Rotary
Generator or break the generator.

To place either right click on a side face of the generator with the
Water Wheel or place it inside a rotary generator.

## Redstone Control

The generator can be disabled by providing a redstone siginal to the
block. This will disable energy transfer in and out of the block.
