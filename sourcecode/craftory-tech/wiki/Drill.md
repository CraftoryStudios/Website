## Overview

This powered tool is used to quickly break single blocks like a
Pick-axe. Each drill is faster than their pick-axe equivalent and they
do not break as they use energy rather than durability.

## Usage

The drill is used the same as pickaxes. It is most effective on blocks
like stone and ores.

slot in any cell, the higher tier cells charge faster.
