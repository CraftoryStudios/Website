## Overview

Craftory is all about extending Minecraft while maintaining a high level
of asthetics and completeness that is normally only seen in mods, making
it unique, as it pushes the boundries of what can be achieved. 

Craftory Tech is all about machines, most of which are powered by
energy, called Redstone Energy (Re). There are many different machines
including [[ElectricFurnace]], Electric [[Foundry]] for combining materials,
[[EnergyCell]] for storing energy, Generators for making it and even a
Power Grid system which allows transfering energy with LASER BEAMS!

Craftory Tech is currently in ALPHA, we have many more features and
machines planned, including improvements to our existing ones.

# First Steps

1\. One of the first things you will want to do is complete some of the
early game of Minecraft to gather enough resources, this includes the
new Ore added by Craftory Tech... Copper. Most machines are made from a
Steel (Iron and Charcoal), Copper, Magnetised Iron and a Core. More on
Crafting Components

2\. The first machine you'll need is the Iron [[Foundry]] (Non Electric
Version). This will be used to start making Steel Ingots, the main
ingredient in crafting machines. By putting fuel in, and then charcoal
and iron ingots in the other two slots you can produce Steel, but be
prepared at this stage its pretty slow.

3\. Before we start generating energy we need one more component,
Magnetised Iron. Craft a Engineers Hammer and a [[MagnatisationTable]],
right click the top of the table with an iron ingot to place it on top.
Now get your hammer and hit the top (left click), particles will appear
and after multiple hits it will become Magnetised Iron! Don't worry this
can also be sped up with an Electric [[Magnatiser]].

4\. Now we have some steel we can start producing power, there are many
generators to pick from, check out the Generators section of the Wiki.
One of the basic ones is the [[SolidFuelGenerator]], this burns normal
minecraft fuels and produces energy, which is stored in its internal
buffer and distributed to machines placed next to it.

5\. So we have power... but what can we do with it. Firstly you can make
an Electric [[Foundry]] which will speed up your steel production. You can
also make [[ElectricFurnace]] which are faster than regular ones. Craft
one of these and plop it down next to the generator so its touching.
[[ElectricFurance]] Recipe

Energy won't start transfering straight away. Right click the generator
to open up the interface, here we can see the battery on the left and
output config on the right. Each square on the output config is colour
coded to match up with a side, click the side your furance/foundry is on
and the output config square on the interface will go green. Now energy
will transfer to the machine.

Tip: Don't set side config to green on sides your not using, it just
adds extra calculations.

6\. Yay! With our first machine going we can now work on adding more, by
crafting higher tier ones they have faster and better stats, but also
higher energy and crafting costs.

7\. Storage... If your a hoarder and you want to start collecting energy
ready for those large scale smelting projects, then the [[EnergyCell]] is
for you. When connected (Placed next to or by Power Grid) to a block
providing energy it will begin to store it. These blocks have high
capacities, as well as input and output.

7\. Got multiple based or want to go more than a few blocks without
chaining cells. For this purpose we have the Power Grids. These evenly
distribute energy to all connected machines and if theres any stare to
energy cells.

First get a Power Connector and a [[Wrench]]. Place the Power Connector down
away from your generator. You can now right click the Power Connector to
start a connection and click the generator. This will draw a laser beam
between them showing its connected to the grid. This beam will only show
when holding a powered block or wrench.

Now place a machine a few blocks away and right click the cell, then the
machine. This should form a new connection. You should now see energy
transfer from the generator to the machine. You can even connect Power
Connectors together in a chain or any other pattern.

8\. For large scale projects you can build a [[Configuratior]], this allows
you to copy output configs. Left click to copy and right click to paste!
Shift Right click to clear currently copied config or just copy a
different one.

### Check out the Machines Section of Wiki!

We will have new machines coming very soon, we have spent our time so
far laying the ground work to allow high performance and the ability to
quickly add new features in the future.
