## Overview

Foundries are used to combine two materials together. Currently their
only use is the production of steel from Iron Ingots and Charcoal or
Coal Dust.

## Tiers

| Tier    | Storage Size | Speed | Energy Usage |
|:--------|:-------------|:------|:-------------|
| Iron    | 5000 Re      | Base  | 20 Re/t      |
| Gold    | 10,000 Re    | +25%  | 30 Re/t      |
| Diamond | 25,000 Re    | +50%  | 50 Re/t      |
| Emerald | 50,000 Re    | +75%  | 100 Re/t     |


## Usage

Right clicking on the block will open the GUI. To combine materials
together, insert them into each input slot on the left-hand side, the
product will appear in the right hand output slot once the process is
complete.

The Iron Foundry requires fuel to run. Any Minecraft fuel source can be
inserted into the bottom slot to be burned as fuel. (The Electric
Foundries do not require fuel and consume power instead.)

Electric Foundries require power. They can be powered by either linking
it to a Power Grid, or placing a Generator or Power Cell with enough
power and its output configuration setup to output towards the furnace.


## Power Grid

Electric Foundries can be connected to a power grid with a power
connector, as with all machines. Foundries have the same priority as
other machines, power on the grid will be evenly distributed to all
machines.

## Breaking and Placing

Foundries can be instantly broken by any tool including player hand
instantly (this will be changed in the future).

When placed the block will not face the direction the player was facing,
it will orient its self to always face North (this will be changed in
the future).

## Redstone Control

A Foundry can be disabled by providing a redstone siginal to the block.
This will disable energy transfer in and out of the block.
