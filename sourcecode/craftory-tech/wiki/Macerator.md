## Overview

Macerators are used to double ores and create dust!

By inserting an Ore and providing power this machine will quickly begin
to produce 2 dust of that ore. This dust can then be smelted, each dust
giving one ingot each.

They can also be used to grind up Diamonds and other things to create
dust used in crafting recipes.

## Usage

Connect to a energy source and right click the block to open GUI. Here
you can insert any Ore or Valid Item into the left slot (can be shift
clicked), if the power requirement is met the machine indicator will
change to on and it will begin processing.

Once the ore has been processed Dust for the relevant item will appear
in the Right slot. This process can be automated with hoppers putting
into any side and pulling out bottom.

## Power Grid

Macerators can be connected to a power grid with a power connector, as
with all machines.

## Breaking and Placing

Macerators can be instantly broken by any tool including player hand
instantly (this will be changed in the future).

When placed the block will not face the direction the player was facing,
it will orient its self to always face North (this will be changed in
the future).

## Redstone Control

A Macerator can be disabled by providing a redstone siginal to the
block. This will disable energy transfer in and out of the block.
